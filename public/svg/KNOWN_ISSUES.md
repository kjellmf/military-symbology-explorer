# Known SVG Issues

The following document is for tracking known SVG issues and their current status. Please feel free to update this table over time. When these are resolved, the status of "Open" should be changed to reflect the link to the merge that addresses them, or a note that says they are closed as-is and the justification for why they were closed without change (in case they are as-designed).
