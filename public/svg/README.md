## Naming

All files are named according to select portions of the 20-character Symbol Identification Code (SIDC) in order to give them proper uniqueness and consistency.

For symbol assembly purposes, the following SIDC positions are used to determine what icons are to be used to create the proper symbol layers. Note: all of these icon layers do not apply to all Symbol Sets.

![Image of SIDC](sidc.png)

- Frame (Folder: `Frames` - Characters: 7): Uses SIDC positions 3-7, with an underscore between the first digit in the name and the last digit in the name. Purple filled frames for Civilian units, equipment, and installations have a ‘c’ at the end of the file name.

- Main Icon (Folder: `Appendices\XXX` - Characters: 8): Uses SIDC positions 5-6 and 11-16.

  - Note: For full-frame main icons (main icons that touch the frame), there is an additional suffix depending on the frame that the icon must touch:
  - \_0 = Unknown
  - \_1 = Friend
  - \_2 = Neutral
  - \_3 = Hostile

- Modifier 1 (Folder: `Appendices\XXX\mod1` - Characters: 5): Uses SIDC positions 5-6 and 17-18 along with the number 1 at the end.

- Modifier 2 (Folder: `Appendices\XXX\mod2` - Characters: 5): Uses SIDC positions 5-6 and 19-20 along with the number 2 at the end.

- Echelon (Folder: `Echelon` - Characters: 3): Uses SIDC positions 4 and 9-10.

- Amplifier (Mobility/Towed Array) (Folder: `Amplifier` - Characters: 3): Uses SIDC positions 4 and 9-10.

- Headquarters(HQ)/Task Force(TF)/Feint/Dummy(FD) (Folder: `HQTFFD` - Characters: 4): Uses SIDC positions 4-6 and position 8.

- Status/Operational Condition Amplifier (OCA) (Folder: `OCA` - Characters: 1 or 6, depending on style): The standard allows for two styles of these. File names vary based on which style is considered.
  - The default version (overlaid / or X) this uses SIDC position 7.
  - The optional version (colored bars) this Uses SIDC positions 3-7 along with an additional value of 2 at the end.
